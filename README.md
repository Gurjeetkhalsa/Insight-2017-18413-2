Microsoft PowerShell for the NetApp Storage Administrator

## Who this is for:
* You have at least some experience with PowerShell (or another scripting language).
* Part of your work responsibilities include managing ONTAP storage devices.
* Currently using GUI, CLI or some scripting.
* This will go from the very basics of PowerShell to examples of automating your storage administration tasks.
* You won’t be an expert in PowerShell or ONTAP storage administration using PowerShell after using this. However, you should leave with some basic fundamental building blocks necessary for developing more advanced scripts.

## Some topics we wanted to talk more about (but couldn’t due to time)
* Error handling
* PowerShell Adapted Type Systems (ATS) and Extended Type Systems (ETS)
* Scopes (I have 99 PowerShell problems, and scoping is all of them!)
* Classes (PowerShell v5+)
